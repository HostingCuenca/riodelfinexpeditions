      "description": "I am Jacob Tangoy, a young man born and raised in the Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest, in the Kichwa community of Zancudo Cocha, on the banks of the Aguarico River. There I completed my primary education and, with great determination, walked two days through the jungle to continue my secondary studies. Later I graduated in Tourism and Hospitality in Nuevo Rocafuerte, and supplemented my training with language courses in English and French. With that learning, I returned to the jungle where I grew up to accompany my parents and develop, together with my family, a community tourism project in the place where I was born. Today we work on a sustainable project that promotes the conservation and protection of our biodiversity, as well as the preservation of our Amazonian culture, in alliance with our community. I cordially invite you to be part of this dream that seeks to keep the Amazon alive, protect its forests and value the wisdom of the peoples who inhabit it. Together we can continue caring for this natural treasure for future generations.",
